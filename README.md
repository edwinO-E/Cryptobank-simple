# Cryptobank-simple
CryptoBank is a simple Solidity smart contract where users can deposit and withdraw Ether while their balance is tracked in a mapping and limited by a maximum balance. An admin set at deployment can update the maxBalance, and the contract emits events for deposits and withdrawals.
